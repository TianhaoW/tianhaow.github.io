## Project Experiences

#### Agricultural Futures Price Prediction
*Data Science Project* | *Erdos Institute Bootcamp* | *Spring 2025* | 
[*Project Page*](https://tianhaow.github.io/ErdosAgriDerivPredict/)

- Led a 5-member team to develop predictive models for U.S. 
agricultural futures prices by integrating market, weather data and USDA reports.
- Aligned multi-frequency time series via interpolation and forward-filling. 
Spatially aggregated weather data using KNN near the crop regions.
- Performed EDA across data sources using **seaborn/matplotlib**. Identified 
  a few predictive signals with > 0.1 correlation to short-term price change.
- Trained **LSTM**, **XGBoost**, **VAR** models to predict next-day and 3-day 
  log returns. Evaluated performance using R2 score and directional accuracy.
- Deployed results to a **GitHub Pages** site using **Jekyll**. Built a 
  **Flask** backend to serve daily model predicton.

#### Independent Game Development 
  *Game Development Project* |  *2019-2020* 
  | [*Game Link*](https://tianhao-wang.itch.io/become-witch-the-story-of-lunaria)
  - Designed and developed a 2D platformer action RPG from scratch using 
    **C++** and **SDL**, without relying on existing game engines.
  - Engineered a custom game engine based on the **Entity-Component-System 
    (ECS) architecture** to manage game objects and systems efficiently.
  - Implemented core gameplay mechanics, including combat systems, player controls, and enemy AI behaviors.
  - Achieved over 4,000 views and 500 downloads to date, demonstrating user engagement and interest.

## Teaching Experiences

- **Associate Instructor**, *Summer 2024*  
  Instructor for Math 121A (Upper-Division Linear Algebra), UC Irvine.
- **Teaching Assistant**, *2016 - 2026*  
  Teaching assistant for Calculus, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Number Theory and Math Finance
  - Received *Excellent Teaching Award* (2018).
  - Nominated for *Most Promising Future Faculty Award* (2024)
