## Algebraic Closure

**Definition / Theorem (Algebraic closure inside a field).**  
Let $E/F$ be a field extension, and suppose $\alpha, \beta \in E$ are algebraic over $F$. Then so are:

- $\alpha \pm \beta$
- $\alpha \beta$
- $\alpha / \beta$ (provided $\beta \ne 0$)

As a corollary, the set:

$$ \overline{F}_E := \{ \alpha \in E : \alpha \text{ is algebraic over } F \} $$

is a subfield of $E$ containing $F$. It is called the **algebraic closure** of $F$ in $E$, and is the largest algebraic subextension of $F$ inside $E$.

> **Proof.**  
> It suffices to observe that if $\beta$ is algebraic over $F$, then it is also algebraic over $F[\alpha]$.  
> Since $F[\alpha, \beta]$ is a finite extension of $F[\alpha]$, and $F[\alpha]/F$ is also finite, the Tower Law gives that  
>
> $$ [F[\alpha, \beta] : F] < \infty $$
>
> so $F[\alpha, \beta]/F$ is a finite (and hence algebraic) extension. Therefore, any element formed from $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using field operations (except division by 0) is algebraic over $F$.

**Definition / Theorem (Algebraically closed field).**  
A field $F$ is called **algebraically closed** if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. Every non-constant polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ has a root in $F$.  
2. Every non-constant polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ splits completely as  
   
   $$ p(x) = c \prod_{i=1}^n (x - \alpha_i),\quad \alpha_i \in F $$

3. If $E/F$ is an algebraic extension, then $E = F$.

> **Proof (Sketch).**  
> - $1 \Rightarrow 2$: Use induction on the degree of $p(x)$. If $p(x)$ has a root $\alpha \in F$, factor it as $(x - \alpha)q(x)$ and apply the inductive hypothesis to $q(x)$.
>
> - $2 \Rightarrow 3$: If $E/F$ is algebraic and $\alpha \in E$, then $\alpha$ is a root of its minimal polynomial $m_{\alpha, F}(x) \in F[x]$, which must split in $F$ by assumption. Hence, $\alpha \in F$, so $E = F$.
>
> - $3 \Rightarrow 1$: Let $p(x) \in F[x]$ be a non-constant polynomial. If $\alpha$ is a root of $p(x)$ in some extension, then $F(\alpha)/F$ is algebraic. By assumption, $F(\alpha) = F$, so $\alpha \in F$.

**Definition.**  
Let $F$ be a field. An **algebraic closure** of $F$ is a field extension $\overline{F}$ such that:

1. $\overline{F}/F$ is an algebraic extension.  
2. $\overline{F}$ is algebraically closed.

**Theorem (Existence of Algebraic Closure).**  
Let $F$ be a field. Then there exists an algebraically closed field $\overline{F}$ such that $\overline{F}/F$ is algebraic.

> **Proof (Sketch).**  
> We construct the algebraic closure using [Zorn’s Lemma](../20_Miscellaneous/Zorn's_Lemma.md).
>
> Let $E/F$ be any algebraic extension (possibly $F$ itself). Define:
>
> $$ \mathcal{G} := \{ L \mid E \subseteq L,\ L/F \text{ is algebraic} \} $$
>
> partially ordered by inclusion.  
>
> Let $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{G}$ be a chain, and define:
>
> $$ \widetilde{L} := \bigcup_{L \in \mathcal{C}} L $$
>
> Since all the fields in the chain are algebraic over $F$ and nested by inclusion, their union $\widetilde{L}$ is also a field and an algebraic extension of $F$ (proof omitted). Thus, $\widetilde{L} \in \mathcal{G}$, so every chain has an upper bound.
>
> By Zorn’s Lemma, $\mathcal{G}$ has a maximal element $\overline{F}$.
>
> We claim that $\overline{F}$ is algebraically closed. Suppose not: then there exists a non-constant polynomial $p(x) \in \overline{F}[x]$ with no root in $\overline{F}$.
>
> Let $\alpha$ be a root to $p(x)$. Then $\alpha$ is algebraic over $\overline{F}$, and hence algebraic over $F$. The field $F(\alpha)$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ containing $\overline{F}$ properly, contradicting maximality. Hence, $\overline{F}$ is algebraically closed.

**Remark: Why Algebraic Closures Matter**

The key benefit of knowing that an algebraic closure exists is this:

> **There is always a field where every polynomial in $F[x]$ splits completely.**

In other words, every root of any polynomial over $F$ can be found **somewhere inside a single field** — the algebraic closure $\overline{F}$. This allows us to treat roots as concrete objects and study how they interact — rather than worry about whether they exist.

This simplifies many arguments in field theory. For example:

- We can always speak of 'the roots' of a polynomial, even if they don’t live in $F$.

- We can define a **splitting field** as a subfield of $\overline{F}$ generated by the roots.

- We can study automorphisms of $\overline{F}$ that permute these roots — which is the starting point of Galois theory.

Even though the algebraic closure is huge and hard to describe explicitly, its mere existence is what makes the whole theory work.

**Theorem (Uniqueness of Algebraic Closure)**  
Let $F$ be a field. Then all its algebraic closure are closed upto isomorphism.
